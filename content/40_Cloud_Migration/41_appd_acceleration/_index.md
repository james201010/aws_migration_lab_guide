### What is AppDynamics?

<span class="small-text">You may not be familiar with the visibility AppDynamics provides for the different layers of your application:</span>

<table class="table-with-icon-and-wrapped-text">
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text">Microservice visibility based on our APM product</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text">Dynamically instrument your microservices</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text">Distributed tracing with detailed diagnostics to identify bottlenecks</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text">End User Experience monitoring for browser and mobile apps</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text">Deep insights for Databases (supporting over 10 Database vendors)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text">Real time business performance analytics and monitoring</td>
   </tr>

<span class="small-text">And most importantly, the key benefit of our integrated platform, is the ability to correlate between these layers.  So if there's a performance issue with your browser app, AppDynamics has the ability to correlate that with potential microservice performance issues that might be the root cause.  The same applies to our business performance monitoring. You can build a real time view of your business KPIs like loan application processing, based on events in your end user and microservice applications. Being able determine if there's a issue with a microservice that's negatively impacting the business KPIs leads to better business outcomes.</span>
