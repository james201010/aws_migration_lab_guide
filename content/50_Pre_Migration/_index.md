### Introduction

<span class="small-text">Nathan is the Lead Architect for the migration project at AD-Financial.  Nathan is concerned about  the complexities and risks of migrating large production workloads and has been comparing the strategies, practices, and tools that have proven their value, leading to a successful migration.</span>

<!--SITUATION -->
<span class="small-text">There are as many reasons to move to the cloud as companies out there and, at one point, those companies will have to decide on a cloud-migration posture.
 <!-- COMPLICATION --> Every company's motivation, constraints and goals to move to the cloud are different <!-- IMPLICATION --> hence each cloud migration journey is unique.<!-- POSITION --> That uniqueness grants the need for a careful planning of the cloud migration during the **Pre-Migration Phase**.</span>

<br>

<!-- ACTION -->
#### In the **Pre-Migration Phase** you need to define:

<table class="table-with-icon-and-wrapped-text">
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text"><a href="https://awsmigration.appdpartnerlabs.net/50_pre_migration/51_why_what_how.html#why-are-you-migrating"><strong>Why are you migrating ?</strong></a></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text"><a href="https://awsmigration.appdpartnerlabs.net/50_pre_migration/51_why_what_how.html#what-is-changing"><strong>What is changing ?</strong></a></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text"><a href="https://awsmigration.appdpartnerlabs.net/50_pre_migration/51_why_what_how.html#how-do-you-deliver"><strong>How do you deliver ?</strong></a></td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="main-row">
      <td class="sm-icon"><i style="color: #3e3071;" class='fas fa-circle fa-xs'></i></td>
      <td class="sm-text"><a href="https://awsmigration.appdpartnerlabs.net/50_pre_migration/51_why_what_how.html#observability-scope"><strong>Observability scope ?</strong></a></td>
   </tr>   
</table>



<span class="small-text">Once the Why, What, How and Observability Scope questions have been answered then those responses need to be transformed/implemented into the changes that need to be introduced to the production environment and supporting systems (this means that the needed configuration, coding, tooling and so forth has to be completed and tested before moving to the <strong>Migration Phase</strong>)
<!-- BENEFIT -->
The more effort you put on rigorously completing the <strong>Pre-Migration Phase</strong> the more successfull and smooth transition to the cloud you experience.</span>
